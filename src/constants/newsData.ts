        title: "Ramadan Food Distribution 2024: Reaching 500+ Families",
        excerpt: "Al Ameen Foundation successfully distributed food packs to over 500 families during the holy month of Ramadan, ensuring no family goes hungry during Iftar.",
        content: `
      <p class="mb-4">The holy month of Ramadan is a time of reflection, prayer, and community. For many families in Kinniya, however, it is also a time of financial struggle. Al Ameen Foundation's annual Ramadan Food Distribution drive aims to alleviate this burden.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This year, thanks to the generous support of our donors, we were able to reach a milestone of 500+ families. Each food pack contained essential items including rice, flour, sugar, dates, lentils, and cooking oil - sufficient to last a family for two weeks.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Our volunteers worked tirelessly over three days to package and distribute these items directly to the doorsteps of the most vulnerable members of our community, including widows, orphans, and the elderly.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Impact beyond food</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Beyond the nutritional support, this initiative brings hope and a sense of belonging to our beneficiaries. "It is not just about the food," said Fatima, a recipient mother of three. "It is knowing that our community has not forgotten us."</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Our new initiative targets 200 additional students from low-income backgrounds in the Kinniya region. The support package is comprehensive, covering:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Full sets of school uniforms and shoes</li>
        <li>Complete stationery kits (notebooks, pens, mathematical instruments)</li>
